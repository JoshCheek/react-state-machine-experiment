Looking at using a state machine to manage a React Component's state.
Video walking through the code is [here](https://vimeo.com/313473814).

**UPDATE:** One of my old students refactored it for me and showed me that this
can be rewritten much more simply, his version is [here](https://github.com/gkhalsa/counter-reload).
I can see that it's much simpler than mine, but I don't quite know how to get
from where I was to where he wound up at. I'll have to analyze it a bit more,
I guess.
